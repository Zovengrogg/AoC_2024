# How did I solve the first output?
# The last 3 bits of B must be the bin(instruction[0])[2:] by the output
# Before that, B is reassigned by B XOR C, both of which we don't have information on yet
# So, start at the beginning and work your way to the end
# The last 3 bits of A can be anything so B can be anything, we have 8 cases
# For all cases:
#     B = B ^ 1
#     if B == 000 then C = (001) 
#     if B == 001 then C = (x00)
#     if B == 010 then C = (xx1)
#     else C = (xxx)
#     B = B ^ 5
#     try can you replace 'x' in C such that B ^ C = bin(instruction[0])[2:] OR B ^ bin(instruction[0])[2:] == C where x is wild

# We then cut of the B portion of A with A = A // (2**B)
# We know some more information about A depending on the initial B and the found C that we need to maintain
# Recursively solve the problem for the next output for each remaining possible A
